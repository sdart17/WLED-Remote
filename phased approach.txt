Looking at your ESP32-S3 WLED remote project, I can see that Phase 1 optimizations have been well-implemented with memory-safe String handling, smart display updates, and improved touch stability. Let me analyze the current performance bottlenecks and recommend Phase 2 improvements.
Current Performance Analysis
Remaining Critical Issues:

All network operations still block the UI thread - HTTP requests can take 500-800ms each
SD card icon loads during interaction - First-time asset loads cause visible frame drops
Power indicator lag - Takes 5+ seconds to reflect external/battery changes
WiFi reconnection blocks UI - Can freeze interface for several seconds

High-Impact Issues:

Duplicate periodic sync calls - Called from both loop and queue processing
Touch controller I²C at only 400kHz - Could be faster for lower latency
Unnecessary SD bus occupation - SD card stays mounted after boot

Phase 2 Recommendations
Based on the performance analysis, here's my recommended Phase 2 approach:
<artifacts:create type="text/markdown" title="Phase 2 Performance Optimization Plan">
Phase 2 Performance Optimization Plan
Critical Priority (Highest UI Impact)
1. FreeRTOS Network Task (HIGHEST IMPACT)
Problem: All HTTP/WiFi operations block UI thread for 500-800ms
Solution: Move all network operations to dedicated FreeRTOS task on Core 0

UI stays on Core 1 (default)
Network task handles all WLED communication
Queue-based command passing between cores
Estimated improvement: 70-80% reduction in UI blocking

2. SD Asset Preloading (HIGH IMPACT)
Problem: First icon loads cause 100-200ms frame stalls
Solution: Preload all icons at boot, unmount SD afterward

Load all required BMPs to PSRAM during setup()
UI renders from memory-cached bitmaps only
Call SD.end() after preloading
Estimated improvement: Eliminates all mid-interaction stalls

3. Power State Acceleration (MEDIUM-HIGH IMPACT)
Problem: 5+ second lag on external power detection
Solution: Faster power state checking with hysteresis

Check power state every 500ms instead of 1000ms
Reduce stability requirements from 6/4 readings to 3/2
Estimated improvement: <1s power indicator response

High Priority (Frequent Issues)
4. Eliminate Duplicate Sync Calls (MEDIUM IMPACT)
Problem: WLEDClient_periodicSync called from multiple locations
Solution: Consolidate to network task only

Remove periodicSync from main loop
Handle in network task with proper timing
Prevents re-entrancy issues

5. I²C Performance Optimization (MEDIUM IMPACT)
Problem: Touch controller at 400kHz, could be faster
Solution: Test 1MHz I²C clock

Wire.setClock(1000000) for touch controller
Add fallback if unstable
Estimated improvement: 20-30% touch latency reduction

Implementation Strategy
Phase 2A (Safest, Highest Impact)

SD asset preloading
Power state acceleration
Eliminate duplicate sync calls

Phase 2B (Requires Careful Testing)

FreeRTOS network task
I²C speed optimization

Risk Assessment

SD Preloading: Low risk, high reward
Power State: Low risk, addresses user complaint
Network Task: Medium risk, massive performance gain
I²C Speed: Low risk, easy to revert

Expected Results
After Phase 2A:

Eliminate all mid-interaction stalls
<1s power indicator response
More stable overall performance

After Phase 2B:

Completely responsive UI during network operations
20-30% faster touch response
Professional-grade user experience

Specific Implementation Recommendations
For immediate implementation (Phase 2A), I'd focus on:

SD Asset Preloading - This will have the most visible user impact with zero risk
Power State Acceleration - Directly addresses your noted issue about 5s lag
Sync Consolidation - Simple cleanup that prevents edge cases

The FreeRTOS network task (Phase 2B) would be the most transformative change but requires more careful implementation and testing.
Would you like me to implement Phase 2A first, or would you prefer to tackle the FreeRTOS network task for maximum performance impact? I can provide the complete updated code files for whichever approach you prefer.
The current codebase is well-structured for these optimizations - your Phase 1 memory safety improvements created an excellent foundation for these next-level performance enhancements.
